	<h1>Consumer Policy</h1>
    <p>Fipra is uniquely placed to guide you in the world of non-governmental and consumer policy. Fipra's Consumer Unit involves experienced and connected consumer activists. Members of our Consumer Unit have experience across a broad range of industries and issues, sector-specific regulation and competition to international trade. </p>
    <p>Fipra undertakes studies into issues of relevance to consumer policy. Please dowload the most recent study on the role of consumers' organisations and of consumer welfare in competition policy <a href="http://www.fipra.com/aux_file.php?aux_file_id=26" href="http://www.fipra.com/aux_file.php?aux_file_id=26" target="_blank">here</a> (paper copies are available on request - please contact <a href="http://www.fipra.com/contact_form/149/" href="http://www.fipra.com/contact_form/149/" target="_blank">Claire Kavanagh</a>).</p>
    <p>The world of competition and anti-trust policy and regulation is increasingly a world of consumer welfare and complex consumer-focused debates. Officials and the wider world speak the language of consumer welfare and expect to hear it spoken back to them. The Fipra Consumer Unit works with national and international consumer organisations, national and international regulators and as appropriate with companies and other corporate entities to help them understand the world of consumer policy. As experienced, committed and current consumer activists, the Consumer Unit's does not offer its services to everyone. If you have a case or a problem whose solution will enhance consumer welfare we are here to help.</p>
